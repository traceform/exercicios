## Scenario

Your task is to complete the code in order to evaluate the results of four basic arithmetic operations.

The results have to be printed to the console.

You may not be able to protect the code from a user who wants to divide by zero. That's okay, don't worry about it for now.

Test your code ‒ does it produce the results you expect?

We won't show you any test data ‒ that would be too simple.

## Code:
```python
# input a float value for variable a here
# input a float value for variable b here

# output the result of addition here
# output the result of subtraction here
# output the result of multiplication here
# output the result of division here

print("\nThat's all, folks!")

```

  <summary>Hint</summary>

  ```python
  a = float(input("Enter first value: "))
  b = float(input("Enter second value: "))
  
  # output the result of addition here
  # output the result of subtraction here
  # output the result of multiplication here
  # output the result of division here
  
  print("\nThat's all, folks!")
  ```

  <summary>Sample Solution</summary>

  ```python
  a = float(input("Enter first value: "))
  b = float(input("Enter second value: "))
  print("Addition:", a + b)
  print("Subtraction:", a - b)
  print("Multiplication:", a * b)
  print("Division:", a / b)
  print("\nThat's all, folks!")
  ```
