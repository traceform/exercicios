#### Language:
1. Alphabet
2. Lexis
3. Syntax
4. Semantics

#### Actions that form a Program:
1. Input
2. Processing
3. Output

#### Compilation vs Interpretation
1. COMPILATION
- Doesn't need compiler to work
- Usually faster, but can't be easily edited
- May take time to fully compile
- Source code is hidden from the user and can't be shared easily as it needs to be compiled for each kind of architecture

2. INTERPRETATION
- Needs interpreter to work
- Usually slower than compiled because the computer resources are shared among the source program and the interpreter itself
- Happens instantly, line by line
- Source code is easily shareable and works anywhere there is a interpreter

#### Python is:
- a high-level programming language with dynamic semantics
- an interpreted programming language
- object-oriented
- used for general-purpose programming
- easy and intuitive, understandable, suitable for everyday tasks
- easy to learn
- easy to teach
- easy to use
- easy to understand
- easy to obtain

#### How to read Python:
> `var = 1`
> - The first line of the snippet creates a new variable named var and assigns 1 to it.
> - The statement reads: assign a value of 1 to a variable named var.
> - We can say it shorter: assign 1 to var.
> - Some prefer to read such a statement as: var becomes 1.

> `var = var + 1`
> - The third line assigns the same variable with the new value taken from the variable itself, summed with 1. Seeing a record like that, a mathematician would probably protest ‒ no value may be equal to itself plus one. This is a contradiction. But Python treats the sign = not as equal to, but as assign a value.
> - Take the current value of the variable var, add 1 to it and store the result in the variable var.
> - In effect, the value of variable var has been incremented by one, which has nothing to do with comparing the variable with any value.

> `function_name(argument)`
> - First, Python checks if the name specified is legal (it browses its internal data in order to find an existing function of the name; if this search fails, Python aborts the code)
> - second, Python checks if the function's requirements for the number of arguments allows you to invoke the function in this way (e.g., if a specific function demands exactly two arguments, any invocation delivering only one argument will be considered erroneous, and will abort the code's execution)
> - third, Python leaves your code for a moment and jumps into the function you want to invoke; of course, it takes your argument(s) too and passes it/them to the function;
> - fourth, the function executes its code, causes the desired effect (if any), evaluates the desired result(s) (if any) and finishes its task;
> - finally, Python returns to your code (to the place just after the invocation) and resumes its execution.

'False', 'True' - boolean values
'None' - Null equivalent in python
'and', 'or', 'not' - logical operators
'in', 'is' - ?
'if', 'elif', 'else' - conditions
'while', 'for', 'break', 'continue' - loops
'def', 'return' - functions
'import', 'from', 'as' - working with modules and libraries

## Functions:
#### A function may:
1. cause some effect. Ex.: print()
2. or evaluate a value. Ex.: sqrt()
- have parameters to accept (positional/keyword) arguments

#### Known
`print()`, 

#### Operators:
- Basic: `**`; unary `+`, unary `-`; `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`; binary `+`, binary `-`
- Assignment: '='
- Shortcut: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `//=`, `%=`

#### Cool things to keep in mind:
- `2 % 4` equals 2 because 2 - 4 * (2 // 4) = 2 - 4 * 0 = 2 - 0 = 2
- `2 % -4` equals -2 because 2 - (-4) * (2 // -4) = 2 - (-4) * -1.0 = 2 - 4 = -2
- `9 ** 0.5` evaluates the square root of 9
- `9 * 0.1` evaluates 10% of 9
- `9 * 1.1` evaluates 9 + 10% of 9

#### Best practices:
- Comments: Comments are very important. They are used not only to make your programs **easier to understand**, but also to **disable those pieces of code that are currently not needed** (e.g., when you need to test some parts of your code only, and ignore others).
- Variable names: Whenever possible and justified, you should give self-commenting names to variables, e.g., if you're using two variables to store the length and width of something, the variable names `length` and `width` may be a better choice than `myvar1` and `myvar2`.
- It's good to **describe** each important piece of code with comments, use **self-commenting** and **readable** (non-confusing) variable names, and sometimes it's better to **divide your code** into named pieces (e.g., functions). In some situations, it's a good idea to write the steps of computations in a clearer way.

#### Remember:
- function:
    - positional argument: arguments passed in the positional way which means the meaning of the argument is dictated by its position
    - keyword argument:
        - the meaning of these arguments is taken not from its loation (position) but from the special word (keyword) used to identify them
        - it consists of three elements: a **keyword** identifying the argument; an **equal sign** and a **value** assigned to the argument. Any keyword arguments have to be put **after the last positional argument**
- literal: data whose values are determined by the literal itself. Ex.: `123` vs `c`. `123` is *one hundred twenty three*. What about `c` though? Does it represent any value? Maybe. It can be the symbol of the speed of light, for example. It can also be the constant of integration. Or even the length of a hypotenuse in the sense of a Pythagorean theorem. There are many possibilities. **You cannot choose the right one without some additional knowledge.** And this is the clue: `123` is a literal, and `c` is not. You use literals **to encode data and to put them into your code**.
- operator: symbol of the programming language, which is able to operate on the values.
- expressions: formed when data and operators are connected together. The simplest expression is a literal itself.
- comment: a remark inserted into the program, which is ommited at runtime.
