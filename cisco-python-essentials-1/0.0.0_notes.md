#### Language:
1. Alphabet
2. Lexis
3. Syntax
4. Semantics

#### Program:
1. Input
2. Processing
3. Output

#### Compilation vs Interpretation
1. COMPILATION
- Doesn't need compiler to work
- Usually faster, but can't be easily edited
- May take time to fully compile
- Source code is hidden from the user and can't be shared easily as it needs to be compiled for each kind of architecture

2. INTERPRETATION
- Needs interpreter to work
- Usually slower than compiled because the computer resources are shared among the source program and the interpreter itself
- Happens instantly, line by line
- Source code is easily shareable and works anywhere there is a interpreter

#### How to read Python:
> - `var = 1`
> - The first line of the snippet creates a new variable named var and assigns 1 to it.
> - The statement reads: assign a value of 1 to a variable named var.
> - We can say it shorter: assign 1 to var.
> - Some prefer to read such a statement as: var becomes 1.

> - `var = var + 1`
> - The third line assigns the same variable with the new value taken from the variable itself, summed with 1. Seeing a record like that, a mathematician would probably protest â€’ no value may be equal to itself plus one. This is a contradiction. But Python treats the sign = not as equal to, but as assign a value.
> - Take the current value of the variable var, add 1 to it and store the result in the variable var.
> - In effect, the value of variable var has been incremented by one, which has nothing to do with comparing the variable with any value.

#### Functions:
1. cause some effect. Ex.: print()
2. or evaluate a value. Ex.: sqrt()
- have parameters to accept (positional/keyword) arguments

#### Keywords:
```known
['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']

'False', 'True' - boolean values
'None' - Null equivalent in python
'and', 'or', 'not' - logical operators
'in', 'is' - ?
'if', 'elif', 'else' - conditions
'while', 'for', 'break', 'continue' - loops
'def', 'return' - functions
'import', 'from', 'as' - working with modules and libraries
'try', 'except', 'finally', 'raise' - validation
'with', 'as' - working with files
```

Need to learn: 'assert', 'class', 'del', 'global', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'pass', 'yield'

#### Operators:
- Assignment: '='
- Basic: **, unary +, unary -, *, /, //, %, binary +, binary -
- Shortcut: '+=', '-=', '*=', '/=', '//=', '%='

#### Cool things to keep in mind:
- 2 % 4 equals 2 because 2 - 4 * (2 // 4) = 2 - 4 * 0 = 2 - 0 = 2
- 2 % -4 equals -2 because 2 - (-4) * (2 // -4) = 2 - (-4) * -1.0 = 2 - 4 = -2
- 9 ** 0.5 # square root of 9
- 9 * 0.1 # 10% of 9
- 9 * 1.1 # 9 + 10% of 9

#### Remember:
- literal: data whose values are determined by the literal itself. Ex.: 123 is a literal, and c is not. You use literals to encode data and to put them into your code.
- operator: symbol of the programming language, which is able to operate on the values.
- expressions: formed when data and operators are connected together. The simplest expression is a literal itself.
- comment: a remark inserted into the program, which is ommited at runtime.
