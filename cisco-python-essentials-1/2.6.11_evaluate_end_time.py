''' 2.6.11 **LAB** Operators and expressions â€“ 2

## Scenario

Your task is to prepare a simple code able to evaluate the **end time** of a period of time, given as a number of minutes (it could be arbitrarily large). The start time is given as a pair of hours (0..23) and minutes (0..59). The result has to be printed to the console.

For example, if an event starts at **12:17** and lasts **59 minutes**, it will end at **13:16**.

Don't worry about any imperfections in your code - it's okay if it accepts an invalid time - the most important thing is that the code produces valid results for valid input data.

Test your code carefully. Hint: using the % operator may be the key to success.
