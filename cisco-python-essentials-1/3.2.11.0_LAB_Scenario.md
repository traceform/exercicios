3.2.11   **LAB**   The _continue_ statement – the Pretty Vowel Eater

---

## Scenario

Your task here is even more special than before: you must redesign the (ugly) vowel eater from the previous lab and create a better, upgraded (pretty) vowel eater! Write a program that uses:

- a `for` loop;
- the concept of conditional execution (_if-elif-else_)
- the `continue` statement.

Your program must:

- ask the user to enter a word;
- use ==`user_word = user_word.upper()`== to convert the word entered by the user to upper case; we'll talk about **string methods** and the `upper()` method very soon - don't worry;
- use conditional execution and the `continue` statement to "eat" the following vowels _A_, _E_, _I_, _O_, _U_ from the inputted word;
- assign the uneaten letters to the `word_without_vowels` variable and print the variable to the screen.

Look at the code in the editor. We've created `word_without_vowels` and assigned an empty string to it. Use concatenation operation to ask Python to combine selected letters into a longer string during subsequent loop turns, and assign it to the `word_without_vowels` variable.

Test your program with the data we've provided for you.

  

## Test data:

**Sample input:**

```
Gregory
```

**Expected output:**

```Output
GRGRY
```

**Sample input:**

```
abstemious
```

**Expected output:**

```Output
BSTMS
```

**Sample input:**

```
IOUEA
```

**Expected output:**

```Output

```

## Code:
```python
word_without_vowels = ""

# Prompt the user to enter a word
# and assign it to the user_word variable.


for letter in user_word:
    # Complete the body of the loop.

# Print the word assigned to word_without_vowels.

```
